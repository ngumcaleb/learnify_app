# ⚛️ Frontend Challenge: Help Barry Connect His React App!

## Barry's Frontend Story
Barry has built a beautiful React frontend for his learning platform with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and dark mode support. But right now it's using dummy data and not connected to any real backend. Help Barry transform his static app into a dynamic, API-powered application that his users can actually interact with!

## 🎯 Your Frontend Mission
Barry needs you to connect his React app to the backend API and implement proper state management. The app should fetch real data, handle loading states, and provide a smooth user experience.

### Phase 1: Fix the Routing (30 minutes)
Barry's course details page isn't properly filtering lessons by course ID. Fix the routing and data flow so users see the correct lessons for each course.

### Phase 2: API Integration (1.5 hours)
Replace Barry's dummy data with real API calls:
- Set up Axios or fetch with proper base URL and authentication
- Create API service functions for all endpoints
- Update components to use real data instead of dummy data
- Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: Redux State Management (1.5 hours)
Implement Redux Toolkit for complex state:
- Set up Redux store with proper configuration
- Create slices for courses, lessons, and user progress
- Implement async thunks for API calls
- Add caching to reduce unnecessary API requests
- Persist lesson completion status to localStorage

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (30 minutes)
Add finishing touches and prepare for production deployment.

## 🏗️ Frontend Architecture
Barry has organized his code nicely:

```
frontend/src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/         # Route components
├── context/       # React context (dark mode)
├── dummydata/     # Mock data (to be replaced)
├── types/         # TypeScript interfaces
└── App.tsx        # Main app component
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Routing Fixes
- [ ] Fix course details page to filter lessons by courseId
- [ ] Ensure lesson navigation works from course details
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid IDs

### Phase 2: API Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Axios/fetch
- [ ] Create API service functions for all endpoints
- [ ] Replace dummy data with API calls in components
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces

### Phase 3: Redux Implementation
- [ ] Install and configure Redux Toolkit
- [ ] Create course slice with async thunks and caching
- [ ] Create lesson slice with async thunks and caching
- [ ] Create progress slice with localStorage persistence
- [ ] Add loading and error states to Redux

### Phase 4: Bonus Features
- [ ] Implement course content caching
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for lesson completion
- [ ] Create progress indicators
- [ ] Add offline support or other UX improvements

## 🔗 API Endpoints to Integrate
```
GET /api/courses          # All courses
GET /api/courses/:id      # Specific course
GET /api/lessons/:courseId # Lessons for a course
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Barry's app already has dark mode and responsive design - preserve these!
- Use TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Handle loading states to prevent UI flickering
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Test on mobile devices to ensure responsiveness

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ All courses load from the API and display correctly
- ✅ Course details page shows correct lessons for each course
- ✅ Lesson pages load and display markdown content
- ✅ Navigation works smoothly between pages
- ✅ Dark mode functionality preserved
- ✅ Responsive design works on mobile devices
- ✅ No console errors or TypeScript errors

### Automated Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite to verify your implementation:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- ✅ App component renders without crashing
- ✅ Footer displays correct branding
- ✅ Dark mode context integration
- ✅ Component rendering and interactions
- ✅ Layout structure and accessibility

**Key Test Cases:**
- App rendering and routing
- Component integration with providers
- Footer branding and styling
- Dark mode context functionality
- Layout structure and responsive design

### Integration Testing
- API calls return expected data formats
- Error states handled gracefully
- Loading states prevent UI flickering
- Redux state updates correctly
- Local storage persistence works
